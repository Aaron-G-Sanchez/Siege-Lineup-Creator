## Description

This web app lets a user create a team composition lineup for the game Rainbow 6 Siege. When the user first enters the website, they are greeted with an option to view other lineups or create a new one. If the user decides to create a new lineup, they will select between either attacking or defending, and then select an operator and their equipment one at a time until they have a full 5 stack. Once a full stack is created, the user can then save the lineup and start again.

This application is designed to help add some creativity to a team composition.

A Trello board was used to keep track of development progress and can be viewed [here](https://trello.com/b/8RTk9Yhl/siege-lineup-creator).

If you decide to make a new team, you will be given the oppertunity to pick from creating a team of attackers or a team of defenders. Depending on the choice, you will then be able to select from any of the operators in the game. Once the team is saved it can be viewed on the view teams page where every created team is displayed.
