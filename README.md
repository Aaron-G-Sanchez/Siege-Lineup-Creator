## Description

This full stack MERN application lets a user create a dynamic team composition for the game Rainbow 6 Siege.

Whether attacking or defending, this appliction helps bring some stability to more competative teams that want to define what operators to bring to a round.

A Trello board was used to keep track of development progress and can be viewed [here](https://trello.com/b/8RTk9Yhl/siege-lineup-creator).

## Getting Started

Navigate to the website [here](). When you arrive on the webpage you have the option to view all operators in the game, create a team and view previously created teams.

If you decide to make a new team, you will be given the oppertunity to pick from creating a team of attackers or a team of defenders. Depending on the choice, you will then be able to select from any of the operators in the game. Once the team is saved it can be viewed on the view teams page where every created team is displayed.
