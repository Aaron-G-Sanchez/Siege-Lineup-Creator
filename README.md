## Description

This web app lets a user create a team composition lineup for the game Rainbow 6 Siege. When the user first enters the website, they are greeted with an option to view other lineups or create a new one. If the user decides to create a new lineup, they will select between either attacking or defending, and then select an operator and their equipment one at a time until they have a full 5 stack. Once a full stack is created, the user can then save the lineup and start again.

This application is designed to help add some creativity to a team composition.

A Trello board was used to keep track of development progress and can be viewed [here](https://trello.com/b/8RTk9Yhl/siege-lineup-creator).
